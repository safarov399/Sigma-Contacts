<h1 align="center">Sigma Contacts</h1>
<p>A contacts application that I am developing with the goal of making it identical to Google Contacts. The word sigma has been chosen as a reference to the famous internet meme.</p>
<p>I am using the MVI architecture for the development process. The app is divided into distinct modules such as <code>data</code>, <code>domain</code>, and <code>feature</code> (including its submodules). Additionally, I have created <code>BaseFragment</code> and <code>BaseViewModel</code> classes for stateful components to minimize boilerplate code and establish a clear structure.</p>
<p>Feel free to explore the code to understand the structure and development process. While contributions are not accepted (read below), learning from and reviewing the code is encouraged!</p>
<h2 align="center">ðŸš¨ DISCLAIMER ðŸš¨</h2>
<p>This is a personal project, and I am not accepting contributions or code submissions from others. Please refrain from submitting code as it will not be reviewed or merged. Thank you for understanding!</p>
<h2 align="center">ðŸ“œ Note to Google ðŸ“œ</h2>
<p>This application is developed solely for self-improvement and educational purposes. I do not intend to monetize or commercially distribute this app. Please understand that this is a personal learning project, and I fully respect Googleâ€™s intellectual property rights. All icons have been taken from the original Google Contacts app by decompiling.</p>
